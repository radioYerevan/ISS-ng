###Instructions for local installation

1. First, clone the repo. 
2. There are two options from here:
  * do an `npm-install` to grap all of the gulp dependencies and run `gulp` in the command line. The app will automatically launch on localhost:8000 unless your gulp setup topples over for some reason.
  * If this seems like overkill, you could install a simple http server by running `npm install http-server -g`. You can then cd into the app/ directory and run http-server. You'll be prompted as to where the app is available.
